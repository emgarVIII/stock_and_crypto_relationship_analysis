# Stock Market & Cryptocurrency Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes the relationship between the stock market and cryptocurrency markets, focusing on how they interact and influence each other. Specifically, it explores whether cryptocurrency returns (**Bitcoin and Ethereum**) correlate with the returns of a widely used stock market benchmark, the **SPY ETF**, which tracks the **S&P 500 index**.

If you want to open this file for viewing, a **PDF version** is available. If you'd like to work on it, the **QMD file** can be loaded in **RStudio** for further research.

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of **daily data from 2017-11-09 to 2024-12-10**, covering key variables such as:
- **Daily closing prices**
- **High and low prices**
- **Trading volumes**
- **Smoothed prices** (average of high and low prices)

This timeframe was chosen because it captures significant cryptocurrency adoption milestones while ensuring consistent data availability for all assets.

## Key Variables  
The main outcome variable of interest is the **daily return of Bitcoin (BTC)**, which represents the percentage change in Bitcoinâ€™s value from one day to the next.  

### Predictors & Variables Include:
- **Returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum** (numeric variables)
- **Prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SPY** (numeric variables)
- **Day of the week** (categorical variable) to examine potential weekday effects
- **Trading volumes** for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SPY to explore correlations (numeric variables)

## Personal Motivations & Interest  
I conducted this analysis for two main reasons:

1. **Personal Experience**  
   I actively participate in both the stock and cryptocurrency markets. Naturally, many questions arise about the potential connections between these two markets, and I want to explore those relationships.

2. **Helping Others Transition**  
   Many people are interested in getting started with trading in either the stock or cryptocurrency markets. Some are more familiar with one market than the otherâ€”most people are generally more accustomed to the stock market, as it is more established.  
   This analysis serves as a **helpful resource** for anyone looking to transition from one market to the other.  
   Since my target audience includes **beginners or those with little technical experience**, I provide thorough explanations to ensure clarity.

## Important Terms to Know  
If youâ€™re unfamiliar with stock or cryptocurrency markets, here are some essential terms:

### 1. Market Capitalization  
**Market capitalization**, or **"market cap"**, is the total market value of an asset or company.  
It is calculated as:  
`Market Cap = Current Price Ã— Total Number of Outstanding Shares/Coins`

Market cap is a **key measure** of an assetâ€™s size and perceived stability in comparison to others.

### 2. Volume  
Volume measures the **total amount of an asset traded** over a given period.  
- **High volume** indicates strong investor interest or market activity.  
- **Low volume** may signal indecision or a lack of engagement.  

In this analysis, **volume helps explore relationships** between market activity in SPY, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.

### 3. Daily Return  
The **daily return** is the percentage change in an assetâ€™s price from one day to the next.

### 4. ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)  
An **ETF** is a pooled investment security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or asset. ETFs can be traded on an exchange like a stock.  

- **SPY** is an ETF that mirrors the performance of the **S&P 500 Index**, making it a common benchmark for the U.S. stock market.

- ## Areas for Improvement / Further Development  
(Based on feedback from Professor Linero at **UT Austin**)

The following aspects are **missing, need revision and/or can be improved**:

- **State the number of observations per group** (for binary/categorical variables).
- **Correctly interpret categorical coefficients**
- **Use transformations to improve model fit** (or provide justification if not necessary).
- **Analyze interactions** between variables and their effects (for example, on returns).
- **Further test Hypotheses 2 & 3** with additional statistical measures.
